Practical No 6

Aim: Georeferencing Topo Sheets and Scanned Maps, Georeferencing Aerial Imagery and Digitizing Map Data. 

Step 1 – Layer > Add Layer > Add Vector Layer. Select the following .shp file and hit add. 

Step 2 – Make sure that the georeferencer plugin is installed. Raster > Georeferencer. 

Step 3 	File > Open Raster. Select the file you want to open and click open. 

Step 4 	Select any point on the map and then click on from map canvas. 

Step 5 – Click the approximately at the same point from map canvas and then hit OK. 

Step 6 	Similarly you can add as many points as you like. Once you are done click on settings > transform settings. 

Step 7 – Set the following parameters and then click OK. 

Step 8 	Now click the start georeferencing button. 

Step 9 You can reduce the transparency from layer properties to see is georeferencing is done properly. 

Step 10 Now open a new project. And install the open layers and OSM place search plugin plugin. 

Step 11 Web > OpenLayers plugin > OpenStreetMap. 

Step 12 Find the gateway of India using OSM place search.

Step 15 – Add points as done before. 

Step 16 Set the following parameters in Transformation settings and then click run Georeferencing. 

Step 17 – Now open a new project. Layer > Add new layer > Add Raster Layer. Select the following .tif file and hit add. 

Step 18 – Open leyer properties go to the pyramids tab, select all the pyramids and click build pyramids. 

Step 19 Settings > Option. Go to the digitizing tab and set the following parameters and click OK. 

Step 20 Layers > New Layer > New SpatialLite layer. 

Step 21 – Set the following parameters and click OK. 

Step 22 Add roads as you like and change their properties.
